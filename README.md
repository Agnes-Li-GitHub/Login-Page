# Login-Page

It is a passwordless authentication application using PHP and MySQL database. A user has to use his/her email address to authenticate and access the server. Once authenticated, the server sends an email message to the user’s email account with a token that contains the user’s identity and a one-time secret. With this token and before the token is expired, the user is allowed to access pages in this Web application.
